This approach does not require a complete sampling frame ‚Äî a list of all units in the population ‚Äî making it relatively fast, convenient, and cost-effective. However, because selection is not random, the resulting sample may not accurately represent the population, and any inferences drawn are subject to potential (non-quantifiable) bias.\n",

        "- **Snowball sampling**: Similar to convenience sampling, except participants are asked to refer others to the study. This can expand the sample but still suffers from self-selection bias.\n",
        "- **Quota sampling**: Aims to ensure demographic balance by filling pre-set quotas (e.g., 50% male, 50% female). While designed to improve representativeness, it is not random and risks over- or under-representing subgroups.\n",
        "- **Purposive sampling**: Participants are deliberately selected because they fit specific characteristics or criteria relevant to the study (e.g., interviewing only experts on climate change). This method can provide rich insights but is vulnerable to researcher bias and lacks generalisability."
